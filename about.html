		<h1>About</h1>
		<p class="par">The inspiration for this project was my childhood. Maths came naturally to me, but most 
			<br> of my friends struggled. They would go to extra lessons and get tutors. They were always
			<br> upset because of all the answers marked wrong, even if they got more correct answers than
			<br> the previous test. With these games I hope to encourage children to practice their maths
			<br> skills. I have designed the game so that instead of right and wrong, you get multiple tries
			<br> to get the answer as well as hints to the answer. I hope to add more games in the future.</p>
