GUESSMYGAMES

https://britfitzm.github.io/


This is the repository for my ALX Holberton School Software Engineering portfolio project.

I am working on this project alone to push myself to do hard things.

Update: due to the incident of my laptop blue-screening, I have scaled down the project because of time loss and deadlines. Due to the deadlines I have not managed to create the games in Javascript.

I am using GitHub Pages for my project webpage where the games can be played.

The game was originally written in C language, but after much research and trials, I have decided to change to Javascript. The webpage is made with HTML and styled with CSS.
The game is fully functional in C-code.

The point of the game is to encourage children to learn and practice maths. There are no scores and you get multiple chances to get the answer right.

The Game:

You select your age from a range of options -
1 - 5 yrs to 6 yrs
2 - 7 yrs to 9 yrs
3 - 10 yrs to 13 yrs
4 - 14 yrs to 16 yrs

You select the game you would like to play - 
1 - guess colour
2 - guess animal
3 - guess number
4 - addition
5 - multiplication
6 - subtraction

Each age group has different guides to accomodate how far they are in their learning process - 
the amount of tries vary between ages
the amount of items vary between ages
the numbers vary between ages
