This is the repository for my ALX Holberton School Software Engineering portfolio project.

I am using GitHub Pages for my project.

I am working on this project alone to push myself to do hard things.

Update: due to the incident of my laptop blue-screening, I have scaled down the project because of time loss and deadlines.

The game is written in C language and the webpage is in HTML and CSS.

The point of the game is to encourage children to learn. There are no scores and you get multiple chances to get the answer right.

The Game:

You select your age from a range of options -
1 - 5 yrs to 6 yrs
2 - 7 yrs to 9 yrs
3 - 10 yrs to 13 yrs
4 - 14 yrs to 16 yrs

You select the game you would like to play - 
1 - guess colour
2 - guess animal
3 - guess number
4 - addition
5 - multiplication
6 - subtraction

Each age group has different guides to accomodate how far they are in their learning process - 
the amount of tries vary between ages
the amount of items vary between ages
the numbers vary between ages
